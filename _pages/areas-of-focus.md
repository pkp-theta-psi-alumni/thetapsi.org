The goals of alumni chapters can be broken down into five objectives, the first
being Infrastructure, the basic framework that an organization needs in order to
maintain sustainably. These required actions must be completed each year in order
to be remain in good standing. The other four make up the key components of alumni
engagement: Information, Interaction, Involvement and Investment.

The Five Areas of Alumni Chapter Excellence not only provide a roadmap to
determine what to focus on / prioritize, they also allow for others to understand
what each alumni chapter provides. For the purposes of communicating the extent of
alumni chapter operations and evaluating performance for awards, the Five Areas
of Alumni Chapter Excellence stratify alumni organizations into
[several status levels](https://pikapp.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Five_Area_Alumni_Focus.pdf)
based on the total number of actions that completed each year.

Recognized alumni chapters are those who have the basic requirements completed
each year in order to remain ‘in good standing’ with the national headquarters.
These requirements are enough to achieve and maintain an alumni chapter charter,
and be afforded the following rights:

* Liability Coverage
* 10 Votes at Supreme Chapter
* Recognition on Pi Kappa Phi website and in Star & Lamp
* Regular communication and educational opportunities through the national headquarters.
