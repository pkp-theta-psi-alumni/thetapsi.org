As an initiated member of Pi Kappa Phi you took a vow to be a brother for life.
Your dues are important to this organization, both the alumni chapter and undergraduate chapter.

Alumni dues work differently than undergraduate dues. Instead of a pre-determined amount, we ask that
you pay what you are able to afford, and what you feel is a fair and appropriate amount to support
the mission of the alumni chapter.

Your dues support the follow initiatives:

- Undergraduate scholarships and chapter support
- Alumni event programming and planning
- Technology and tools used by the alumni chapter

A full breakdown of expense reports and budgets are available for anyone who is interested.
Reach out to the alumni chapter treasurer for more information.
